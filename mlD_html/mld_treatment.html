	        <p class="header-sub-pages">An integrative practice healing through Acupuncture, Tui Na and Qi Gong</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">Tui Na Massage uses such techniques as pushing, rolling and traction to identify where tension resides in the body. The massage involves a spiraling techniques that pushes the Qi energetically into the body. This means that the TUI NA practitioner inputs  an energetic impulse into the body, which can be interpreted diagnostically  on its return. This motion releases resistance while creating  a therapeutic connection between healer and patient.</p>

	        <p class="text-pages"> Acupuncture is balanced with Tui Na to provide a complete treatment.  Once tissues unfurl through massage, tensions are located and the body becomes receptive to the healing stimulation of the acupuncture needles. Throughout the session, open communication encourages confidence in each step.  The amount of challenge needed to rally the body’s natural healing system is assessed by locating trigger points (tight and tender points through touch) through touch. The placement, depth and trajectory of the needle, in relation to a patient’s ease, is considered during all parts of the process. Holistic using a Chinese template (includes whole body...patterns of tension within body)</p>

	        <p class="text-pages">Cupping, an ancient Chinese medical practice, is sometimes performed after consulting the patient. Involving  de-constraining  local tissue by suction, it re-establishes the flow of Qi  through the area, thereby breaking stasis and stagnation.</p>
	        
	        <p class="text-pages">Treatment lasts over an hour, allowing time for communication, diagnosis, treatment and, most importantly, healing.</p>
