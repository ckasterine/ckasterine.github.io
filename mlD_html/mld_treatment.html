	        <p class="header-sub-pages">Healing through Acupuncture and Tui Na</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">Acupuncture is balanced with Tui Na to provide a complete treatment.  As tissues relax through massage, specific areas of tension can be more easily located and treated through the use of the acupuncture needles. Throughout the session, open communication encourages confidence in each step. Both traditional acupoint combination strategies, as well as trigger point (ashi) release, are utilized. The placement, depth and trajectory of the needle, in relation to a patientâ€™s ease, is considered during all parts of the process.</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">Tui Na massage uses such techniques as pushing, rolling and traction to identify where tension resides and to mitigate it. The massage involves spiraling and wave-like techniques that help induce the free flow of Qi through the body. Energy is input, which is then interpreted diagnostically by the practitioner upon its return. This motion releases structural resistance, while creating a therapeutic connection between healer and patient.</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">Another modality sometimes used is Cupping, an ancient Chinese medical practice, also found in the West. The technique deconstrains local tissue through suction, breaking stasis and stagnation, thereby re-establishing the flow of Qi through the area.</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">Treatment lasts over an hour, allowing time for communication, diagnosis, treatment and, most importantly, healing. Marshall has a high success rate in his practice, often correcting chronic pain patterns in usually three treatments.</p>
