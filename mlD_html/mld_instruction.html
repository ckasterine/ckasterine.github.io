			<p class="header-pages">Instruction</p>
			<p class="text-pages">As a teacher with over 15 years of experience in the field of Chinese Medicine, Marshall has developed a methodology that incorporates not only Acupuncture (needling), but Tui Na based bodywork techniques that render an effective, holistic approach to healing and well-being. He places an importance on maintaining a relaxed, structurally aligned physical ability, utilizing underlying principles of Qi Gong to help prevent the fatigue that can overtime have a deleterious effect on a bodywork provider.</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">Marshall is a graduate of Tri-State College of Acupuncture (2002), where he is currently conducting <a href=http://www.tsca.edu/course/marshallwoodgr/ target="blank">Grand Rounds</a>. In addition, Marshall is developing a Tui Na Bodywork curriculum that can be applied towards fulfilling continuing education unit (CEU's) requirements.</p>
	        <p class="header-sub-pages">THE FIVE ELEMENT QI GONG (DEMONSTRATION VIDEO)</p>
	        <p class="text-pages">In the video, Marshall steps through the Five Element Qi Gong, demonstrating the techniques, while discussing the philosophy of this age-old system. The Five Elements (Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth) correspond to the underlying energetics and functions of the organs systems, particularly as they pertain to Asian Medicine. Each exercise is structurally designed to affect the organ system to which element is associated with.</p>
