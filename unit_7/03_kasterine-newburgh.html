          <h1>Newburgh: Beauty and Tragedy, <span id="nb-subtext">Documentary</span></h1>

  	         Continuing the long association that began as photography project, Dmitri is now filming the city of Newburgh and those who live there. Determined to provide an intimate record of life in one of New York&apos;s poorest and most violent cities, filming began in 2012, soon after Dmitri's Newburgh photos were mounted on the wall of the Ritz theater. With the help of a small but dedicated film crew consisting of young people born and raised in Newburgh, full production took place during the summer 2015.

             The film has brought the stories behind the photographs to the screen. People that he had photographed as teenagers  resurfaced and spoke about their lives since the photos were taken two decades earlier. New subjects were discovered, and give further insight into the barriers facing the residents of Newburgh today. The film is a result of long relationship that Dmitri feels privileged to be part of and brings forth an intimate but straight forward portrayal of one of America's forgotten cities.

  	         Their stories describe lives of extreme poverty, surrounded by violence and injustice.  Despite of the hardship, Dmitri's film captures the lyrical side of Newburgh and the abiding hope that shines through its residents.

            In 1996, following a tip from a friend one day, photographer Dmitri Kasterine drove 15 miles from his home in Garrison, N.Y., to nearby Newburgh. What he found there was unlike anything he had ever seen before.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dmitri was immediately drawn to the crumbling Victorian houses, the neglected buildings, and, most strikingly, the unassuming grace of the people on the street. But when he tried to take his first photo, his subject told him to go away. Still, Kasterine returned, and kept coming back for the next 20 years.
            <br>
            <br>
            &ldquo;Nobody has ever done quite this,&rdquo; Kasterine says, &ldquo;which is to say, look at these beautiful people.&rdquo;

          <p class="nb-film-txt">
            Newburgh, once deemed &ldquo;America's Most Beautiful City,&rdquo; is now in the unraveled throes of the Post-Great Recession, its public services reduced from an already barebones level to something skeletal. A few years ago, it was one of the most dangerous cities in America, dubiously distinguished by having one of the highest per capita murder rates in the country. The outdoor work on display, the scheme and product of Kasterine&apos;s work from 1995 to 2011 both speaks to these concerns and shirks them.
            <br>
            <br>
            The work represents a people disenfranchised from representation itself; the work makes visible that which has been invisible for decades. The pictured residents of Newburgh have no opportunity to represent themselves as a people who live daily outside the mainstream representation of poverty and violence. Today, Newburgh is slowly turning itself into what many hope will be a sustainable, locally managed and developed community. Dmitri&apos;s work offers that representation: a rebounding city peopled by hopeful folk united in their diverse stories. Newburgh now owns the pictures.

       	  <p id="nb-book-lft-col">
            Kasterine took to photographing this city, producing a great many wonderful portraits, and it is now our duty to look at them. With photography having become a bit too self-centered, a bit too focused on navels and on often petty dramas that don&apos;t invoke anyone but the photographer, this book might serve as a good reminder that there is a world out there, and it&apos;s not necessarily a pretty world.
            <br>
            <br>
            It&apos;s not necessarily a pretty world, but it will give those who look and care the gift of being able to make wonderful photographs - photographs that are wonderful because of their beauty, and that are wonderful because they show that someone has an interest in the human condition beyond the walls of their own home. This then might make us, the viewers, take an interest as well.
